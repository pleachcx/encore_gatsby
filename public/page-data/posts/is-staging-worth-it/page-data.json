You may be thinking the walls need a lick of paint, and perhaps that the garden needs a bit of work.</p>\n<p>A lot of people also ask if staging is worthwhile, and what exactly it entails. To clear the air and make your sale a little easier we’ve had a closer look at staging and if it’s the right option for your home.</p>\n<h2>What exactly is staging?</h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, home staging is a process where you accentuate a home’s positive aspects and minimise its negative ones. This is done by arranging furniture, art and accessories in such a way that your property’s appeal is maximised.</p>\n<p>Staging will also remove the personal feel of your home and present it in such a way that buyers will better be able to imagine their lives in it.</p>\n<p>In theory, this helps create a good first impression with buyers and improves your home’s appeal, which should mean more interested buyers and a higher selling price.</p>\n<p>There have been relatively few studies to prove its effectiveness, but many agents stand by staging as a brilliant way to guarantee a sale</p>\n<h2>Is it really worth it?</h2>\n<p>The short answer to the above question is ‘it depends’. Each property is different and buyer preferences vary in different areas – however, there is some hard evidence available that says staging is generally worthwhile.</p>\n<h2>Can I self-stage my home?</h2>\n<p>While a professional stager will most likely do a better job (it’s their profession after all) if money is tight you can definitely stage your home yourself. Remember the following essentials when doing so and you could add value to your home and help it to sell quicker:</p>\n<p><strong>Depersonalise:</strong> remove family photos and personal items. This will allow buyers to visualise living in your home rather than making them feel like intruders.</p>\n<p><strong>Declutter:</strong> get rid of mess and excessive clutter such as small appliances on the kitchen bench.</p>\n<p><strong>Go neutral;</strong> bold colours or quirky designs may put some buyers off, so it’s always best to go for a neutral palette.</p>\n<p><strong>Emphasise space:</strong> use smaller furnishings, mirrors and light colours to make rooms seem larger and more spacious.</p>\n<p><strong>Remove the eyesores:</strong> have a look around your home – are there any pieces of art or furniture that stand out as ugly or dated?</p>\n<p><strong>Add greenery:</strong> flowers, even if they’re fake, will make your home a more pleasant place to be. Add a few potted plants in key rooms around the home.</p>\n<p><strong>Tidy the garden:</strong> get rid of weeds, dog toys, hose reels, cut and edge grass, and make outdoor living areas appear comfortable with cushions and throws.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t over stage:</strong> petals on the bed, cookies in the oven or a setting for a fancy meal may make buyers think you have something to hide.</p>\n<p>If you’re selling a one bedroom apartment in the suburbs staging may not be worth the extra expense. However, if you’re selling the family home, a city centre apartment or any type of premium real estate the few thousand it costs to hire a professional stager could be well worth it.</p>","id":"349859dc-5ddd-57d2-ad98-7dd98143c1dc"},"allPosts":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"f1f88abc-6531-56e9-be40-6d17b1e5c13b"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/kitchen-transformation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kitchen Transformation"}},"previous":null},{"node":{"id":"b5f3d226-6b1e-5d02-baca-b955197172a1"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/home-staging-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home Staging Process"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/townhouse/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Townhouse "}}},{"node":{"id":"181dc98e-3271-574f-8c04-0399c72f1c89"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/styling-to-sell/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Styling to Sell"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/kitchen-transformation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kitchen Transformation"}}},{"node":{"id":"0571ec1a-e8fd-5e51-88d4-e6cfc556c42c"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-home-staging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Home Staging?"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/home-staging-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home Staging Process"}}},{"node":{"id":"745cce48-dbcf-5e34-8b13-bfd4fab69140"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/mountains/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mountains"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/styling-to-sell/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Styling to Sell"}}},{"node":{"id":"e4b1c9e3-380f-5c8a-85d4-326d37cf7e2c"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/post-two/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Post Two"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-home-staging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Home Staging?"}}},{"node":{"id":"b2d2c7b5-123c-5d0f-8ed2-090e71e07045"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/traditional-home-ashburton/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traditional Home Ashburton"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/mountains/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mountains"}}},{"node":{"id":"f07794c5-773e-5dba-926e-cca0ee26da9c"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-unlock-profits/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How To Unlock Profits"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/post-two/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Post Two"}}},{"node":{"id":"912798a9-c923-546e-841b-c02845e2b1cb"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/common-mistakes-in-diy-styling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Common Mistakes in DIY Styling"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/traditional-home-ashburton/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traditional Home Ashburton"}}},{"node":{"id":"6fc3c3f9-1e3d-50e1-9572-12719150c498"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/is-staging-worth-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is Staging Worth It?"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-unlock-profits/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How To Unlock Profits"}}},{"node":{"id":"349859dc-5ddd-57d2-ad98-7dd98143c1dc"},"next":null,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/common-mistakes-in-diy-styling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Common Mistakes in DIY Styling"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"349859dc-5ddd-57d2-ad98-7dd98143c1dc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2001315320"]}
