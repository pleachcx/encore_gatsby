Here are some things to avoid:</p>\n<h3>Displaying family photos, certificates and memorabilia</h3>\n<p>Potential buyers may enjoy looking at your family memories but this will only distract them from what’s important: your house. For a successful open house, visitors must be focused on what your home can offer.</p>\n<h3>Storing items out of sight in cupboards</h3>\n<p>While some potential buyers won’t bother opening up cupboards during their visit, others will want to look behind every closed door. Hiding items in these places will only serve to make storage look over packed and unorganised.</p>\n<h3>Leaving bad habits in plain sight</h3>\n<p>Whether it’s wearing shoes inside or overfilling your hanging space, don’t leave these things for potential buyers to see. They may interpret the smallest thing as an indication that the home was not well cared for. Aim to remove any trace of your busy lifestyle and present a well-kept, neutral home instead.</p>\n<h3>Styling rooms to your personal taste</h3>\n<p>Everyone has different tastes and preferred lifestyles. Styling to your own preferences serves only to alienate potential buyers who don’t share your tastes. Home styling should always aim for neutrality to appeal to as many different people as possible.</p>","id":"1cfb8066-6d05-586b-bc0a-065d029f30a3"},"allPosts":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"2e1ae273-d89b-5d8f-b91e-8bf683df8847"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/contemporary-hamptons-style/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contemporary Hamptons Style"}},"previous":null},{"node":{"id":"7ea6e4e1-816d-5ca3-8c7a-46a8acb879f5"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/kitchen-transformations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kitchen Transformations"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/modern/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modern"}}},{"node":{"id":"5cef2501-9bf1-58f5-9cbd-68eb518c2602"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/traditional/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traditional"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/contemporary-hamptons-style/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contemporary Hamptons Style"}}},{"node":{"id":"d141295f-a097-5aea-bddc-492b2f146336"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/floor-transformations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Floor Transformations"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/kitchen-transformations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kitchen Transformations"}}},{"node":{"id":"a0004b38-3d26-5e1b-9148-2bf2c19f01ce"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/working-from-home/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Working From Home "}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/traditional/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traditional"}}},{"node":{"id":"574f7e96-cc20-5776-a559-955d42e2a912"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/home-staging-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home Staging Process"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/floor-transformations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Floor Transformations"}}},{"node":{"id":"9105bbc2-b0b1-5c38-b30b-8499e39f6462"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/styling-to-sell/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Styling to Sell"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/working-from-home/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Working From Home "}}},{"node":{"id":"d1c4b4db-cd6d-5b50-8117-963e3c1b4a54"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-home-staging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Home Staging?"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/home-staging-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home Staging Process"}}},{"node":{"id":"ac03f82f-cc1c-531b-bfad-56a8218ffbf3"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/common-mistakes-in-diy-styling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Common Mistakes in DIY Styling"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/styling-to-sell/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Styling to Sell"}}},{"node":{"id":"1cfb8066-6d05-586b-bc0a-065d029f30a3"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-unlock-profits/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How To Unlock Profits"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-home-staging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Home Staging?"}}},{"node":{"id":"1ed4fabe-a3b2-527d-afbe-e2a9d93e9c1e"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/is-staging-worth-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is Staging Worth It?"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/common-mistakes-in-diy-styling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Common Mistakes in DIY Styling"}}},{"node":{"id":"6f113a9c-251c-5bd8-8fae-b67874c8e47a"},"next":null,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-unlock-profits/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How To Unlock Profits"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"1cfb8066-6d05-586b-bc0a-065d029f30a3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2001315320"]}
