# Who needs staging?

Anyone that wants a great sales results. 

Open Agents [Katy Holliday](https://www.openagent.com.au/blog/expert-guide-property-styling), suggest says should expect 7.5% to 12.5% increased sales price if your home is professionally staged. Our own results are generally between $100,000 to $300,000 increase in the Melbourne market. 

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/is-home-staging-worth-it/) more than 80% of real estate agents representing buyers said staging helped buyers emotionally connect with homes and led to increased offers. 

[HomeAdvisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/) suggest professionally staged homes experience between 33% and 50% less time on market. That not only means getting the proceeds of a home sale faster, but also spending less money on added expenses such as rental or storage.

Home Staging can help find buyers, get more offers, increase your sale price and sell faster.

# Benefits of Home Staging



**Help your listing stand out online**. With so much competition, your home can easily get lost in the sea of listings across the web. It’s important to do everything you can to stand out. Professionally staged homes are eye-catching and can encourage more buyers to consider your property, even before they see it in person.

**Make your home feel aspirational**. It’s important that the home shopper falls in love with the property they ultimately choose to buy. You can help create that emotional connection between a buyer and your home by staging it. 

**Show ways to use extra rooms and funky floor plans**. When a room is completely empty, it can be tough to envision how it might be used. Staging can help buyers see the potential of a room and how to get the most value out of it.

**Increase the selling price**. If your home has been sitting on the market for a while, and you’ve been considering cutting the price to help move it, you might want to try staging it instead. Staging not only tends to help move properties faster, you could end up selling for higher than expected.
