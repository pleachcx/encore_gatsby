## **Presenting your home at its best is critical for the success of your sale.**

Encore Home Staging combines creative property styling and presentation services, with decades of property and marketing experience. We understand how challenging the selling process can be - our goal is to help make it easier for you to get the best result.

## **Don’t sell your home for less than what it’s worth**

Our lovely clients come to us to maximise the appeal and value of their homes ensuring that they achieve the best possible price.

Open Agents [Katy Holliday](https://www.openagent.com.au/blog/expert-guide-property-styling), suggests you should expect a 7.5% to 12.5% increased sale price if your home is professionally staged and presented well (interior and exterior).  Our own results support this and are generally between a $100,000 to $300,000 increase within the Melbourne market.

Our approach has proven time and time again to financially reward and delight sellers.

## **Our unique presentation services will help you achieve your dream sale price**

We specialise in **home makeover** and **home staging** **presentation services** to maximise the value of homes for sale.

We uniquely offer both services under the one roof, providing you with more options to add value to your home whilst saving you time and money.

## It takes a team of people from stylists to trades

At Encore Home Staging, you only need to deal with one person from start to finish.  Our experienced and friendly client managers ensure that everything is done so that your home is market ready. 

Leave it with us and save yourself both time, money and a potential headache.

## **3 steps to  prepare your home for sale:**

**Step 1** – We meet with you to discuss your needs and requirements (big or small) during a no obligation, free appointment.

**Step 2** – We provide you with a home presentation proposal that will maximise your sale price. We won’t recommend spending one dollar more than you need to in order to achieve this.

**Step 3** – Upon your approval, we assign a skilled team, typically a stylist and trades, to deliver your requirements to present your home and maximise your sale price. 

After engaging our services, clients feel confident knowing that they've done everything within their control to hit their dream sale price.
