# Who needs staging?

Anyone that wants a great sales results.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/is-home-staging-worth-it/) more than 80% of real estate agents representing buyers said staging helped buyers emotionally connect with homes and led to increased offers. 

[HomeAdvisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/) suggest professionally staged homes experience between 33% and 50% less time on market. That not only means getting the proceeds of a home sale faster, but also spending less money on added expenses such as rental or storage.
