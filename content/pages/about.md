## About Us

When I sold my home, I was filled with both pure joy and relief after achieving an enormous uplift in the sale price that surpassed all expectations!

From that day on, I’ve been inspired to help others achieve the same.

The key to my success was a home makeover and home staging.

There is a lot of uncertainty and emotion when selling a home, but the one thing you have control over is beautifully presenting your home both inside and outside to maximise the sale price.

And that’s where we come in…….

The Encore Home Staging approach has proven time and time again to financially reward and delight sellers.

With over 20 years’ experience in professional marketing and an astute understanding of buyer behaviour and property, we ensure that our clients' homes are creatively staged, stand out from competitors and the sale price is maximised.
