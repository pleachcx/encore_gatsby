We understand the pure joy and relief experienced when achieving incredible home sales results, especially when they surpass all expectations! That is why we are inspired to help homeowners achieve the same.

Selling your home is probably the biggest financial transaction of your life and you’ve only got one shot to get it right. However, you don’t have to do it alone – we’re here to help.

**Our services**

Our lovely clients are homeowners who simply do not want to sell for less than what their homes are potentially worth. They come to us to maximise the appeal and value of their homes ensuring that they achieve the best possible price.

We specialise in **home makeover** and **home staging** **presentation services** to maximise the value of homes for sale. Presenting your whole home at its best is critical for your success.

We uniquely offer both services under the one roof, providing you with greater options to add value to your home whilst saving you time and money.

Our presentation services enable our clients to be confident that they’ve done everything within their control to hit their dream sale price.

With over 20 years’ experience in professional marketing and an astute understanding of buyer behaviour and property, we ensure that our clients' homes are creatively staged, stand out from competitors and the sale price is maximised.

The Encore Home Staging approach has proven time and time again to financially reward and delight sellers.

We’d love to help you too.
