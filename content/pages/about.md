# About Us

We understand the pure joy and relief after achieving awesome sale results, especially when they surpass all expectations!  That is why we are inspired to help homeowners achieve the same.

Don't leave money on the table. You only get one shot when selling your home. The stakes are high, as selling your home is probably the biggest financial transaction of your life. It is important to understand and following the process required to maximise buyer interest, and achieve a great result.

The key to our success is our understanding of the process!

We know what is important to your potential buyers and how to maximise buyer demand for your home. Quality and detail of presentation is the foundation of attracting potential buyers.   

And that’s where we come in…….

The Encore Home Staging approach has proven time and time again to financially reward and delight sellers.

With over 20 years’ experience in professional marketing and an astute understanding of buyer behaviour and property, we ensure that our clients' homes are creatively staged, stand out from competitors and the sale price is maximised.

The above diagram illustrates the steps required to achieve great sales results. 

### Photos

High quality photos of your home are vital because the majority of potential buyers are using their phones to browse properties. Almost 100% of buyer interest is generated through the realestate.com.au website, and the only way to standout is with high quality images of your perfectly presented home.

### Drive By

After a potential buyer has viewed your property online, they may decide to complete a drive by inspection. They will inspect your location and street appeal.

### Walkthrough 

If potential buyers are satisfied after driving past, they will attend your open home. Most people will form an opinion of your property within 8 seconds. We want potential buyers to picture themselves living in the home, wanting to own it.

### Inspection / Building Inspection

The magnifying glass comes out and our serious potential buyers going over every nook and crevice. Any damage or issues found at this point will either decrease our potential buyer's threshold price.

### Auction

The more serious bidders attending the auction, the greater your sale price!
