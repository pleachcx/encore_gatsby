## Home Staging

We specialise in beautifully styling (indoors & outdoors) and adding value to homes for sale.

Our primary goal is to maximise your sale price.  

Making a home look beautiful is a true artform and is necessary when selling a home but it won’t maximise the sale price alone. As they say, beauty is only skin deep.

To maximise your sale price, we ensure that each space not only looks appealing, but also adds value to achieve a maximum return. We go deeper and understand your buyers.

Buyers have many considerations when choosing a home and it’s important to know what they are and how your home can be specifically presented to appeal to them.  

The Encore Home Staging approach has proven time and time again to financially reward and delight our clients.

  

**How much does it cost?**

A Home Staging investment can vary in cost because of the differences in homes and the amount of furniture required. You can expect to invest anywhere from $3,000 to $7,000. The following may influence the cost of staging your home:

* Size of home
* Full staging / partial staging

The one thing industry experts agree on is that you’ll have no problems achieving a positive Return On Investment (ROI) when staging your home.

Quoting your home is fast and easy. It is also obligation free.
