# What Is Home Staging?

Home Staging is completed by a property stylist. The stylist will create interior layouts that highlight your homes's features. They will select furniture, artwork, rugs and accessories which will be staged in your home while you market it for sale. 

In order for you to achieve a great sales result the home must be appealing to a broad group of potential buyers. Your stylist will help your home standout against your competitors. Styled homes also take better photos which is very important for your online marketing.

Real estate styling is different to interior design. Interior designs are created to suit your personal taste, while real estate styling is more neutral as to attract the broadest appeal.

Home styling helps buyers emotionally connect with your home, and make them feel like they want to own it.

Our home staging services will help you achieve:


### Maintenance, repairs and renovations

After deciding on a strategy, a stylist will bring in the necessary trades to complete any maintenance, repairs or renovations. You can help by lending a hand or doing some of this work yourself.

### Emphasise space

Each room has many possibilities when it comes to layout. A stylist will assess the available space and make placement choices that emphasise space and make rooms look larger. This may involve simply rearranging what’s already there or bringing in temporary furniture.

### Add warmth and atmosphere

Cold, dreary rooms turn off potential buyers. A stylist knows how to bring warmth to a room and make it feel welcoming.

### Add comfort and convenience
A stylist will create comfortable spaces that offer modern convenience. Potential buyers will be able to see themselves using each space without being distracted by current homeowner lifestyle preferences.

### Improve aesthetics

Rundown or aging properties may struggle to bring in foot traffic on open house day. A stylist will give you tips on how you can add a modern touch to your home to freshen it up.

### Brighten up your home

A stylist knows how to use colour, texture and lighting to make every room shine. Something as simple as adding artwork or accessories can make a big difference on open day. A stylist is your best resource for bringing out the best in your property.

### Sell a lifestyle

Whether your home is by the beach, in the countryside or city central, a stylist will accentuate this and offer a complete lifestyle to potential buyers.
### Set the stage for photography

Photos are often the first thing a potential buyer will see. Therefore, it’s essential that your photos show your home’s maximum potential. A professional photographer can make any home look good but styling combined with professional photography will ensure your home looks great. Stand out from the crowd with top quality photos that will ensure a successful open house.
