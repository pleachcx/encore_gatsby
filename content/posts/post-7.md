# Home Buying Process

The sales funnel above describes why it is critical to complete each milestone. Every step in the process is dependent on the step before it. Therefore, it is critical to successfully complete each milestone in order to achieve a great sales price.

### Photos

High quality photos of your home are vital because the majority of potential buyers are using their phones to browse properties. Almost 100% of buyer interest is generated through the realestate.com.au website, and the only way to standout is with high quality images of your perfectly presented home.

### Drive By

After a potential buyer has viewed your property online, they may decide to complete a drive by inspection. They will inspect your location and street appeal.

### Walkthrough

If potential buyers are satisfied after driving past, they will attend your open home. Most people will form an opinion of your property within 8 seconds. We want potential buyers to picture themselves living in the home, wanting to own it.

### Inspection / Building Inspection

The magnifying glass comes out and our serious potential buyers going over every nook and crevice. Any damage or issues found at this point will either decrease our potential buyer's threshold price.

### Auction

The more serious bidders attending the auction, the greater your sale price!
