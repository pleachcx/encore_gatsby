# The Process

The home staging process has 7 steps:

### 1. Fact Find

Firstly we will discuss the job with you directly. Let us know what your needs and expectations and we will be sure to cover 100% in our proposal.

We will also visit your home and take photos of every room. We will also take notes and familiarise ourselves your colour palette, finishings, lighting etc.

### 2. Home Staging Proposal

After we have assessed your requirements, our team will prepare a proposal. Our proposal will detail creative layouts, furniture to be installed and scope of job.

### 3. Agreement

If you are happy with the proposal and would like to proceed, let us know and sign the agreement form. Our agreement will be clear and detail everyone's rights and responsibilities.

### 4. Home Makeover

Your home may require maintenance, repairs or a makeover. The work will be completed quickly, within schedule and to a high quality. You may decide that you want to DIY and skip this step.

### 5. Preparation

You will need to remove your furniture and clear of clutter. You may want to organise cleaning before furniture also.

### 6. Home Staging

Our team will deliver everything needed to stage your home. The stylist will direct the support staff who will assemble  and place furniture, hang artwork and accessorise. 

### 7. Remove Furniture

After your property sells or our agreement ends, our team will come back and remove all the equipment.
